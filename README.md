# JavaQuizMakerConsole
This is my project from University Java course.

*How to run:
First of all you should save all files in one filder.
Using Terminal(Linux, MacOS) or Console compile QuizMaker.java.

if you had installed Java version 8 and more type to the console: javac QuizMaker.java
After you've compiled it, write: java QuizMaker <name of the .txt file>

*Remember! All files should be on one folder!
